# Projects-management
A management platform to organize tasks and to organize teams. 

# Project Description

Features:

    User Authentication and Authorization:
        Allow users to sign up, sign in, and manage their accounts.
        Implement roles and permissions (e.g., admin, project manager, team member) to control access to different parts of the application.

    Project Management:
        Users can create, view, update, and delete projects.
        Each project can have a name, description, start date, end date, and assigned team members.

    Task Management:
        Within each project, users can create tasks.
        Tasks should have a title, description, due date, priority, and status (e.g., to do, in progress, done).
        Users can assign tasks to team members and set dependencies between tasks.

    Team Management:
        Admin users can manage teams and team members.
        Users can belong to one or more teams.
        Team members can be assigned to projects and tasks.

    Dashboard:
        Provide a dashboard with an overview of projects, tasks, and deadlines.
        Display tasks assigned to the logged-in user.
        Show upcoming deadlines and project progress.

    Notifications:
        Send notifications for task assignments, updates, and approaching deadlines.
        Implement real-time updates using WebSockets for instant notifications.

Tech Stack:

    Backend:
        Framework: Nest.js (Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications).
        Database: SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for storing user data, projects, tasks, etc.
        Authentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.

    Frontend:
        Framework: Angular (JavaScript framework for building client-side web applications).
        Use Angular Material for UI components to maintain consistency and streamline development.
        Implement routing for different views (e.g., project list, task details, user profile).

    Deployment:
        Deploy backend and frontend separately.
        Backend: Deploy on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
        Frontend: Deploy using services like Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting.

    Additional Tools/Technologies:
        Use Sequelize or TypeORM as ORM for database interaction in Nest.js.
        Implement Swagger for API documentation.
        Utilize Git for version control and GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket for repository hosting.

Challenges:

    Real-time Updates:
        Implementing real-time updates for task assignments and status changes using WebSockets can be challenging but rewarding.

    Complex Queries:
        Handling complex SQL queries for generating project/task reports, filtering, and sorting data efficiently.

    Security:
        Ensuring secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

    Scalability:
        Designing the application to handle a growing number of users, projects, and tasks efficiently.

Building a project management system using Nest.js, Angular, and SQL would provide you with a comprehensive full-stack development experience, covering both backend and frontend aspects along with database interactions.
